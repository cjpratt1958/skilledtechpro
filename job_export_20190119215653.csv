Helen is wanting an estimate to start on our services. She has extensive work she's needing help with, including attic fans and circuit breakers.

From Helen:
1) One is a big job: electrical circuit breaker box separating from exterior wall sheathing.

     I need advice on replacing this breaker box with a larger-newer-better box with at least four additional circuits.

     The existing box has been over extended by unlicensed contractors doubling up all circuits.

     I need 4 additional circuits for 4 new GFI exterior grade outlets for gutter heat tape installation.

     The increased circuits plus repair of breaker box will require pulling a permit with the city and working with PowerCo

2) I have one ceiling fan, hardly ever used, that just stopped working. My assumption is that one of the contractors I hired disconnected the electrical connection to my fan while making the connection for a new device circuit/wiring.","Michael Lavallee","DONE","2018-04-09 04:36pm","PARTIAL REFUND","","0","0","1","","",""

For future work, she'd like to be on the same type of payment schedule as she is now (Which was not approved when we did the previous job.) We've told her that's not something we normally do but that we could see if we could work with her depending on what the future job was.

Update: 5/14/18 Jackie has been approved for financing. I've discussed with her the payment options and need to get some better information from synchrony as far as how they do their interest.
I'm fairly certain from speaking with Jackie at this point that she's going to want to go with our service. We still need to schedule with Michelle to check the venting.

Her daughter (Michelle) is our contact in Utah 805.904.5405
as her mother is working on moving down this way. While the appointment will be set with the daughter, the mother would like us to go over options only with her phone. 

Customer is looking into an AC unit for her house. She's wondering about the different type of installs that we do and the systems we work with. She was particularly interested in Trane and Lennox. She wants to know what system would be best for her home.

She mentioned that she wants us to check the duct work to make sure it's adequate. If it's not, I'm certain she would want to add that on as a service.

He is having issues with power to his TV and is unsure whether it's the TV or the wires behind it. He was told by a Comcast representative that the issue lies in the grounding.

 Notes from Josh:

 Found continuity between ground and hot wire behind living room TV. It was not enough leakage to trip the breaker but it was causing problems with his  Electronic's.

Rocky mountain power ;
My name is Carl Pratt and I am a Master Electrician. I have been an electrician since 1976, which puts me at 42 years in the industry as a state licensed electrician.
On 06/26/18 I got called out on a service call after 7:00 pm where the customer was experiencing issues where only half of the house had power and when you walked past the meter main you could smell a strong burning smell.
I opened the Breaker side of the meter main and it was obvious that the main breaker had been so hot that the left side of the buss bar had a melt down and had melted the plastic buss bar mounts away as well as the entire top left of the main breaker had fallen apart and lost connection due to the extreme heat. See pics 
I showed it to the customer and let him know that the service (meter main panel) will need to be replaced.
I gave him a price and suggested that he call his insurance company which he did.
I temporarily got his 110 Volt power back on by putting both legs on the good side of the breaker,  then collected $2,000.00 as a down payment and purchased the materials to get started.
On 06/27/17, at 8:00 am I called Rocky Mountain Power’s office in Portland and arranged for an emergency disconnect and went over to Roy City to pull a permit and to schedule for a same day inspection so I could get the customer’s power back on the same day.
At 10:am I got a call from Thomas Johnson who was sent from Rocky Mountain Power to disconnect the power and he told me that I am trying to rip this customer off and all the customer needed is to get a main breaker from Home Depot and relocate it to an empty slot next to it.
Thomas proceeded to tell the customer that I was trying to rip him off and he does not need a service change at all….. all he needs to do is go over to Home Depot and buy a new 2pole 100amp breaker and relocate it to another slot ( which has 50 amp max rating because of the v cut in the buss bar ) and he will be good…..  so he did.
So now I have a customer that thinks I am a con artist and is demanding his money back. He has an unsafe meter main panel that the plastic insulator separating the un-protected buss bar from the ground is melted away. And a 100 amp main breaker is feeding his house through a buss bar that is only rated for 50 amps max. and the Customer thinks he is safe because Rocky Mountain Power told him he is… As far as the customer is concerned RMP is god because they create electricity and all state licensed electricians work under the authority of RMP.
My understanding is that RMP employees do not have State licenses and cannot touch or advise on topics of the NEC just the same as an Electrician cannot touch or advise on topics of RMP’s side of the business.
I checked with DOPL and found out that Thomas is not even a licensed electrician and has no idea of National Electric Codes, Stringent UL requirements and simply has an ignorance for safety, Thomas is acting as a licensed electrician by telling the public that with the backing and representation of Rocky Mountain Power a Master Electrician who has 42 years under his belt is trying to rip them off by installing a service that in his un-educated mind is not necessary.
 I called Rocky Mountain Power to simply disconnect the Service so I can do my job in a legal and safe manner. Thomas overstepped his boundaries and created an incredible expense on my part as well as an unsafe situation and false sense of security for my customer. And a defamation of my experience and reputation.
Thanks

I need to install a ceiling light with 4 freejack heads. I have everything, just need help installing and setting up the dimming switch. Want it to work with Alexa, ideally. Am replacing an existing fixture, so wiring is all there. Also have a small LED array that I am having trouble getting wired correctly. I had a dimmer with a locator light, but the current used for the locator caused the LEDs to flicker when off. Have a new switch that I hope works. Has a voltage step down for the LEDs. Also need to fix/replace a ceiling fan in bedroom. Would also like to get one that works with Alexa so can control with voice commands. Have not purchased yet. Probably need advice about how to proceed.","Carl Pratt","DONE","2018-10-16 10:21pm","PAID","2018-10-16 10:04pm","180","0","1","","",""

I called RMP for a reconnect
On Wednesday morning, we still did not get our reconnect so I called RMP and they told me that their records showed a reconnect on the 22nd which was Monday and  the ticket was closed. however we still did not have a meter. so I put in a request to have the meter re-installed.
